                <h4>ICT, or information and communications technology (or technologies), is the infrastructure and
                    components that enable modern computing.
                    Although there is no single, universal definition of ICT, the term is generally accepted to mean all
                    devices, networking components, applications and systems that combined allow people and
                    organizations (i.e., businesses, nonprofit agencies, governments and criminal enterprises) to
                    interact in the digital world.
                </h4>
                <p>ICT encompasses both the internet-enabled sphere as well as the mobile one powered by wireless
                    networks. It also includes antiquated technologies, such as landline telephones, radio and
                    television broadcast -- all of which are still widely used today alongside cutting-edge ICT pieces
                    such as artificial intelligence and robotics.
                    ICT is sometimes used synonymously with IT (for information technology); however, ICT is generally
                    used to represent a broader, more comprehensive list of all components related to computer and
                    digital technologies than IT.
                    The list of ICT components is exhaustive, and it continues to grow. Some components, such as
                    computers and telephones, have existed for decades. Others, such as smartphones, digital TVs and
                    robots, are more recent entries.
                    ICT commonly means more than its list of components, though. It also encompasses the application of
                    all those various components. It's here that the real potential, power and danger of ICT can be
                    found.</p><br>

        <img src="https://www.yokogawa.com/eu/blog/oil-gas/app/uploads/2020/04/116137226_s-1440x564_c.jpg"
            alt="cybersecurity" width="25%" style="float:right;" />
        <p>Also referred to as information security, cybersecurity refers to the practice of ensuring the integrity,
            confidentiality, and availability (ICA) of information. Cybersecurity is comprised of an evolving set of
            tools, risk management approaches, technologies, training, and best practices designed to protect networks,
            devices, programs, and data from attacks or unauthorized access.</p>
        <p>Traditional cybersecurity is cantered around the implementation of defensive measures around a defined
            perimeter. Recent enablement initiatives like remote workers and Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies have
            dissolved the perimeter, reduced visibility into cyber activity, and expanded the attack surface.</p>
        <p>Today, breaches are increasing at a rapid pace despite record levels of security spending. Global
            organizations
            are turning to human-centric cybersecurity, a new approach that places focus on changes in user behaviour
            instead of an exponential number of growing threats. Founded on behaviour analytics, human-centric
            cybersecurity
            provides insight into how an end-user interacts with data and extends security controls into all the systems
            where data resides, even if not exclusively controlled by the organization. Ultimately, this approach is
            designed to identify behavioural anomalies in order to surface and prioritize the most serious threats,
            reducing
            investigation and threat detection times.</p>

                        <p>The world relies on technology more than ever before. As a result, digital
                            data creation has surged. Today, businesses and governments store a great deal of that data
                            on
                            computers and transmit it across networks to other computers. Devices and their underlying
                            systems have vulnerabilities that, when exploited, undermine the health and objectives of an
                            organization.</p>
                        <p>A data breach can have a range of devastating consequences for any business. It can unravel a
                            company`s reputation through the loss of consumer and partner trust. The loss of critical
                            data, such as source files or intellectual property, can cost a company its competitive
                            advantage. Going further, a data breach can impact corporate revenues due to non-compliance
                            with data protection regulations. It`s estimated that, on average, a data breach costs an
                            affected organization $3.6 million. With high-profile data breaches making media headlines,
                            it`s essential that organizations adopt and implement a strong cybersecurity approach.</p>

                        <p>Ransomware is malicious software with one aim in mind: to extort money from its victims.
                            It's one of the most prolific criminal business models in existence today, mostly thanks
                            to the multimillion-dollar ransoms criminals demand from individuals and corporations.
                            These demands are very simple: pay the ransom or have your operations severely
                            compromised or shut down completely.</p>
                        <p>Very often, the first an organization knows of an attack is when they receive an
                            on-screen notification informing them that data on their network has been encrypted and
                            will be inaccessible until the ransom has been paid. Only on payment will they be given
                            the decryption key to access their data. Failure to pay could result in the key being
                            destroyed, rendering the data inaccessible forever.</p>

        <p>A data breach is a security incident in which information is accessed without authorization. Data breaches
            can hurt businesses and consumers in a variety of ways. They are a costly expense that can damage lives and
            reputations and take time to repair.</p>
        <p>It may seem like stories of massive data breaches pop up in the news frequently these days. But it shouldn`t
            be all that surprising.</p>
        <p>As technology progresses, more and more of our information has been moving to the digital world. As a
            result, cyberattacks have become increasingly common and costly.</p>
        <p>Globally, the average total cost to a company of a data breach is $3.86 million, according to a study by the
            Ponemon Institute. This means that at $148 on average per stolen record, online crime is a real threat to
            anyone on the internet.</p>
        <p>Corporations and businesses are extremely attractive targets to cybercriminals, simply due to the large
            amount of data that can be nabbed in one fell swoop.</p><br />
        <h4 style="text-align: center;">Your Data Breach Response Checklist</h4>
        <p>We`ve created a 7-step checklist to use in the case of a data breach. Depending on the severity of the breach
            and the information exposed, you`ll need to apply some or all of these steps to varying degree.</p>

                <h3>Confirm the breach and if your information was exposed.</h3><br />
                <p>The first step is to confirm that a breach actually occurred. When a data breach occurs, scammers may
                    reach out to you posing as the breached company to try to obtain more of your personal information.
                    Don't fall for fake emails. Go to the company's secure website and/or call the company to confirm
                    the breach and whether your information was involved.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu1" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Find out what type of data was stolen.</h3><br />
                <p>Why does the type of information exposed matter? While stolen credit cards and the like can be
                    cancelled and replaced, it's quite difficult to obtain a new Social Security number. And fraudsters
                    can do a lot more with your SSN and other unique, sensitive PII than they can accomplish with an
                    email or credit card account.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu2" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Accept the breached company's offer(s) to help.</h3><br />
                <p>If the breached company offers to help repair the damage and protect you for a certain amount of
                    time, unless there have been issues with their offer, take them up on it.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu3" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Change and strengthen your online logins, passwords and security Q&A.</h3><br />
                <p>It's important to immediately change your online login information, passwords, and security
                    questions-and-answers for the breached account(s)—along with your other accounts if they have
                    similar passwords and security Q&A—to limit the reach of the hackers' arms. This step was especially
                    important for victims with stolen email accounts.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu4" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Contact the right people and take additional action.</h3><br />
                <p>This is where the type of data stolen really comes into play. If your credit and/or debit card
                    information was stolen, you should reach out immediately to the financial institution(s) to cancel
                    your card and request a new one. However, if personal information like your Social Security number
                    was stolen, it may be easier for you to become a victim of identity theft. The FTC recommends:</p>
                <p>- Taking advantage of free credit monitoring that may be offered by the company responsible for
                    exposing your information</p>
                <p>- Obtaining your free credit reports from AnnualCreditReport.com to look for activity you don't
                    recognize</p>
                <p>- Considering a credit freeze for your accounts with the three major credit report agencies so it`s
                    more
                    difficult for someone to open a new account in your name.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu5" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>Stay alert; monitor your accounts closely.</h3><br />
                <p>It's important to watch for signs of new activity. In cases where Social Security numbers were
                    stolen, the hackers and others who put their hands on the numbers may use them now or wait years
                    when victims may be less suspecting. Follow the breach-related steps noted above when your Social
                    Security number is exposed.</p>
            </div>
            <div id="menu6" class="tab-pane fade">
                <h3>File your taxes early.</h3><br />
                <p>In US, if your Social Security number has been stolen or you just want to take precautionary
                    measures, you may be able to beat fraudsters to the IRS, making it less likely they'll commit
                    tax-refund identity theft.</p>
